# Hello World

Let's get started deploying your mini-API.

There are five steps to achieving this:

1) Create the project and endpoints via our API.
2) Write the code in your language of choice. In this example, we use Python.
3) Compile it to a binary.
4) Verify the binary.
5) Deploy the binary and check the deployment.

# (1) Create the project and endpoints via our API.

Check out the code in `create_the_project.py`.

The code is heavily commented to outline exactly how it works.

# (2) Write the code in your language of choice. In this example, we use Python.

Modify the `main.py` file in the `my-api` directory to add your own functions and endpoints.

For the purposes of the example, you do not need to modify `main.py`. It should work as is.

# (3) Compile it to a binary.

Review the instructions in `how-to-compile-to-binary.md` to compile your Python program to a binary.

# (4) Verify the binary.

Check out the code in `verify_the_binary.py`.

The code is heavily commented to outline exactly how it works.

# (5) Deploy the binary and check the deployment.

Check out the code in `deploy_the_project.py`.

The code is heavily commented to outline exactly how it works.
