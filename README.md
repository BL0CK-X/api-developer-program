# The Blockchain API Developer Program

We made our <a href="https://docs.blockchainapi.com" target="_blank">API</a>.

Now we want to help you make yours.

## Intro Video

You can watch an intro video here if you prefer that. All of the information in the video is contained within this README.

## Background

Anyone can make their own API already. However, if you do and you intend to make money off of it, 
you'll likely have to complete several steps that do not involve the core coding part you actually enjoy. 

For us, these steps include: managing a cluster of servers, managing a database, accepting payments, analyzing usage, 
managing user authentication, setting up a business bank account, initially operating at a loss before making money, 
creating and managing documentation, marketing the API, and growing the community.

That's a lot.

What if you could only focus on **the coding part** and still make money and preserve your IP?

That's what the purpose of this is. You write the code, you compile it to a binary, and you upload it to our platform.

We automatically create the documentation, manage user authentication, manage the payments, scale your code, and give you 
statistics of API usage so you can adjust accordingly. People already paying for our platform
 immediately have access to your functions, and then you make money every time a paying user calls your function. 

And we can't see your code because it's a binary file.

It's free to be a part of this program and add your functions. **You can't lose money. You can only make money.**

## The Mission

Enable developers to build a profitable API and focus *exclusively* on coding the fun stuff!

## How this Works

1) Create the project
2) Write the functions
3) Compile the binary
4) Verify the binary
5) Upload the binary
6) Get paid at the end of each month

We have a thorough Python example showing how to do all of this in the 
<a href="https://github.com/BL0CK-X/api-developer-program/tree/main/python-api" target="_blank">folder `python-api`</a>.

## How you make money

Like our own functions, each function costs a certain amount of credits.

For each of your functions, you specify how much one call to that costs, from 1 to 100 credits. (If you want a value
outside of that range, let us know.)

### How we convert credits to dollars to pay you

When someone uses your function, you get paid based on what plan that user is on. This is because the plan that the user has activated
determines the cost per credit rate.

The table below maps the subscription type to the amount you would earn per 1k credits used.

Plan | Free Trial | $9 (R) | $9 (M) | $29 (R) | $29 (M) | $99 (R) | $99 (M) | $499 (R) | $499 (M) 
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- 
$ earned per 1k Credits | 0 | **0.9** | 0.9 | **0.29** | 0.58 | 0.198 | 0.396 | 0.0099 | 0.06
(R = reserved, M = metered.)

Example: A $29 plan first receives 100,000 reserved credits for the month.
The rate is $0.29 / 1k credits (29 / 100,000 * 1,000). After the user uses 100,000 credits for the month, they use credits
at the metered rate, which is $0.58 for the $29/mo plan.

As of 03/10, 53% of our users are on the $29 / mo plan and 37% of our users are on the $9 / mo plan. This comprises 90% of all of our users.

Most of these users also do not exceed their reserved credits for the month. Therefore, the most common dollar rate per 1k credits that you would receive
is $0.90 and $0.29.

NOTE: The first pay day might not be until 05/01. We do not yet have a system in place for making payouts. We'd also like your feedback on both how you get paid and how often you'd like to be paid. 

### What we take as a platform fee

Most platforms, like Apple's App Store, take a percentage fee in order to cover their costs.

Until 06/01, we plan on taking **no fee**. In other words, you keep 100% of the credits used when people use your functions.

#### Before 06/01

Note that this is subject to change before 06/01. There are a couple of reasons why we would make the change early:
1) The system is being abused in some capacity.
2) The platform gains so much traction that we need to take a fee in order to be able to afford to scale it.
3) Or we simply need to in order to remain profitable.

#### After 06/01

What type of fee we take and how we structure it is not yet known.

What we can commit to is this: It will not cost money to start making money.

The future platform fee will be anywhere from 10% to 35% of the credits earned, with the most likely range of 20% to 30%.

However, it's really unclear what our costs will be and how this platform will play out. Thus, it's much simpler to just give developers 100% of what they earn at first, and use the data accumulated over time to determine pricing.

#### "Show me the incentives, and I will show you the outcome." - Charlie Munger

I write this section to those who might be worried about building on our platform because our fee is currently subject to change.

Let's assume we were a completely selfish agent that wanted to maximize profits.

We have two incentives in order for this platform to be successful:
1) Ensure developers on our platform are profitable.
2) Be profitable.

Although #2 could conflict with #1, we need *both* to be successful. If developers are not sufficiently profitable, they won't build on our platform.

Therefore, even in the case in which we were cold-blooded wolves, we have a very strong incentive to ensure that you make money and that we don't take an egregious fee.

Furthermore, the more money you make, the more profitable we are. Why is that? When you make more money, that implies you are providing value. Which brings more people to our platform, who then become paying users. And some of these then contribute to our developer program.

So the way I see it, is that we need to focus on #1, and then #2 will follow.
