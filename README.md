# The Blockchain API Developer Program

We made our <a href="https://docs.blockchainapi.com" target="_blank">API</a>.

Now we want to help you make yours.

## Intro Video

You can watch an intro video here if you prefer that. All of the information in the video is contained within this README.

## Background

Anyone can make their own API already. However, if you do and you intend to make money off of it, 
you'll likely have to complete several steps that do not involve the core coding part you actually enjoy. 

For us, these steps include: managing a cluster of servers, managing a database, accepting payments, analyzing usage, 
managing user authentication, setting up a business bank account, initially operating at a loss before making money, 
creating and managing documentation, marketing the API, and growing the community.

That's a lot.

What if you could only focus on **the coding part** and still make money and preserve your IP?

That's what the purpose of this is. You write the code, you compile it to a binary, and you upload it to our platform.

We automatically create the documentation, manage user authentication, manage the payments, scale your code, and give you 
statistics of API usage so you can adjust accordingly. People already paying for our platform
 immediately have access to your functions, and then you make money every time a paying user calls your function. 

And we can't see your code because it's a binary file.

It's free to be a part of this program and add your functions. **You can't lose money. You can only make money.**

## The Mission

Enable developers to build a profitable API and focus *exclusively* on coding the fun stuff!

## How this Works

1) Create the project
2) Write the functions
3) Compile the binary
4) Verify the binary
5) Upload the binary
6) Get paid at the end of each month

We have a thorough Python example showing how to do all of this in the 
<a href="https://github.com/BL0CK-X/api-developer-program/tree/main/python-api" target="_blank">folder `python-api`</a>.

## How you make money

Like our own functions, each function costs a certain amount of credits.

For each of your functions, you specify how much one call to that costs, from 1 to 100 credits. 

When someone uses your function, you get paid based on what plan that user is on. This is because the plan they're on
determines the cost per credit rate.

Plan | Free Trial | $9 (R) | $9 (M) | $29 (R) | $29 (M) | $99 (R) | $99 (M) | $499 (R) | $499 (M) 
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- 
Earned per 1k Credits | 0 | 0.9 | 0.9 | 0.29 | 0.58 | 0.198 | 0.396 | 0.0099 | 0.06

When someone uses your function, you get paid based on what plan that user is on. This is because the plan they're on
determines the $ USD per credit rate.

For example, the FREE plan runs at $0 / credit, the $29 / mo plan runs at $0.00029 / credit, etc.

You determine the amount of credits your function costs. It can cost from 1 credit to 100 credits. If you want something
outside of that range, let us know.

NOTE: The first pay day might not be until 05/01.
