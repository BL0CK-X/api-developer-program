# The Blockchain API Developer Program

We made our <a href="docs.blockchainapi.com" target="_blank">API</a>.

Now we want to help you make yours.

Simply deploy your function using our script and follow the instructions here.

Documentation, infrastructure, and payment will all be handled automatically.

Then, when someone uses your function, you get paid based on what plan they're on. This is because the plan they're on
determines the $ USD per credit rate. 

For example, the FREE plan runs at $0 / credit, the $29 / mo plan runs at $0.00029 / credit, etc.

You determine the amount of credits your function costs. It can cost from 1 credit to 100 credits. If you want something 
outside of that range, let us know.
