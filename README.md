# The Blockchain API Developer Program

We made our <a href="https://docs.blockchainapi.com" target="_blank">API</a>.

Now we want to help you make yours.

## Background

Anyone can make their own API already. However, if you do and you intend to make money off of it, 
you'll likely have to complete several steps that do not involve the code coding part you actually enjoy. 

For us, these steps include: managing a cluster of servers, managing a database, accepting payments, analyzing usage, 
managing user authentication, setting up a business bank account, initially operating at a loss before making money, 
creating and managing documentation, marketing the API, and growing the community.

That's a lot.

What if you could only focus on **the coding part** and still make money and preserve your IP?

That's what the purpose of this is. You write the code, you compile it to a binary, and you upload it to your platform.

We automatically create the documentation, manage user authentication, manage the payments, scale your code, and give you 
statistics of API usage so you can adjust accordingly. People already paying for our platform
 immediately have access to your functions, and then you make money every time a paying user calls your function. 
And we can't see your code because it's a binary file.

And guess what? It's free to be a part of this program. You can only make money --- not lose.

## The Mission

Enable developers to build an API and focus *exclusively* on coding the fun stuff while making money!

## How this Works

Simply deploy your function using our script and follow the instructions here.

Documentation, infrastructure, and payment will all be handled automatically.

Then, when someone uses your function, you get paid based on what plan they're on. This is because the plan they're on
determines the $ USD per credit rate. 

For example, the FREE plan runs at $0 / credit, the $29 / mo plan runs at $0.00029 / credit, etc.

You determine the amount of credits your function costs. It can cost from 1 credit to 100 credits. If you want something 
outside of that range, let us know.
